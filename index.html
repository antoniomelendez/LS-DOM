                <p>Unlike traditional Computer Science programs, Lambda School teaches computer science principles by programming. Instead of starting with theory, we start by building applications, and add on layers of algorithms, abstraction, computer architecture, and theory to make our applications better.</p>
                <p>You'll not only learn the practical skills required to become a software engineer, but how to think abstractly and solve problems from first principles.</p>
